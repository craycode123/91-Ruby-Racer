<div><p>Vroom vroom! We’re going to build a simple game called <em>Ruby Racer</em>. This is a “game” like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders">Snakes and Ladders</a>&nbsp;: the fixed board layout and random rolls of the dice completely determine the outcome.</p>
<p>The game works like a (random and much quieter) drag race. There are two players. Each starts with a “car” sitting at the beginning of the track, side-by-side. The track is <code class="inline">N</code> squares long. Players take turns rolling a die and advance their car according to the value of the roll.</p>
<p>Note that this challenge is about modeling a simple game with little human interaction and no strategy. You’ll learn a bit about how console output works when you have to print the board. The starting code is well-written, so pay attention to the style, what methods exist, what their inputs and return values are, and how they segment the actions necessary to “play” the game.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<h4>Implement Using the Skeleton Code</h4>
<p>The source gist for this challenge contains a lot of skeleton code; use it! You should mostly be filling out the pre-defined <code class="inline">RubyRacer</code> class, although feel free to dress up the output and have a little fun with the logic of the game. Maybe add some totally sweet <a href="https://github.com/miketierney/artii">ACSII art</a>?</p>
<p>Here’s what the output should look like, roughly:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : Are you assuming there are only two players and they’re always labeled <code class="inline">'a'</code> and <code class="inline">'b'</code>? Why? If it’s intentional as a means to get a simpler version up and running, that’s fine, but it’s important to be clear about what assumptions your program is making and why! Try to write a version that accepts any number of players (identified by single characters) as input.  </p>
<h4>Think of Fun Additions</h4>
<p>As a thought experiment, think about what would make this game more fun? Powerups? Landmines that send you back to the start? More player control?</p>
<p>Is your code well-suited to adding these features or would it be difficult?</p>
